						<h1>My Project</h1>
						<p class="info">3 days ago by <a href="#">Ngoc Duan</a></p>

					<p>The project that I wish I could do in the future after graduation was to create an indie game that is as difficult as the "Dark Soul" series, but belongs to the TPS genre. It will be a game that does not focus on the plot but will focus more on the array of gameplay. The game will bring true feeling like in real life war and cause everyone to try to overcome. And not having to design in the form of AAA games, so many types of gamers can experience and play it.</p>
					<p>My idea came from my childhood memories of old games, especially 2 titles that inspired me to get this idea: Call Of Duty and Dark Souls. I have plowed both these series and indeed both games have left me with a deep impression. Then a thought suddenly occurred to me: Why is there no game that combines these two unique points together? And I started to intend to create such a game in the future.</p>
					<p>For this game, I will create a hypothetical game scene during World War II, an Allied soldier survived the Nazi raid. And so he had to pass every line of soldiers and bombs with only a few ammunition. The terrible thing here is that with only 1 or 2 bullets, you have gone to heaven immediately. In addition, the game will have a very loud and realistic sound effect that makes the player feel shocked when a bullet comes out of the barrel of the gun. The game is designed from a third-person perspective to help players feel the surroundings, and the environment in the game will decide for you to go in different directions to complete the goal. Sneaky or face to face are all your options. Let this fight at your fingertips. With an extensive arsenal of weapons and accessories inspired by World War II, surely the most eye-catching and realistic shooting displays will make customers satisfied.</p>
					<p>To be able to create such a game, I need to learn a lot of programming about C ++, Javascript. Regarding the engine, I will choose Unity to create this game. And yet, I will participate in some small projects of some indie game making teams to be able to hone more skills.</p>
					<p>Finally, in order to earn money for this game, I will raise a small amount of capital on Kickstarters, where many game teams they often use to call on people to donate to fund their project. I hope that after the game releases the alpha version, everyone will support this small project.</p>
